# Sales Analysis with Python
In this repo I try some data analysis with Python using sales data.

Some analysis in this repo:
- Read data from multiple file sources and then combine them to one DataFrame.
- Clean data before doing analysis
- Month when order higher
- City with most number of order and sales
- State with most number of order and sales
- Most sold Products
- Products that mostly sold together
- Best time to make advertisement

I also add some visualization to better understanding from the data.
Some analysis followed by visualization when possible.
All that analysis can be used to make better decision and strategy to possibly increase sales.

Idea and data comes from Keith's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4
I try to replicate what he had done and in most cases modify to what I think better way to solve same problem.
